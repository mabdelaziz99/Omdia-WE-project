Open vRAN is expected to represent approximately 7.8% of the total RAN market for the full year 2024.",

            p2:"Based on guidance from operators, Omdia expects a more significant inflection and mainstream adoption of open vRAN from 2025. The long-term forecast is within the same range as before, with open vRAN now expected to represent 18.7% of the total RAN market by 2028, compared with 18.9% in the previous edition of the forecast."
